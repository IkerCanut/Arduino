## Summary
This is an example where a WiDo (Arduino Leonardo) connects to an external TCP Server via WiFi and sends information, like temperature, humidity and a boolean indicating the presence of Ethanol in air. A LCD Screen is used to notify the progress.

You will have to change the WLAN_SSID, WLAN_PASS and, if you do not have a WiDo, the WiDo_IRQ.
